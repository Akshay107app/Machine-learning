# Machine-learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data, identifying patterns, and making decisions with minimal human intervention. These systems improve their performance on a given task over time as they are exposed to more data.

Key Concepts
Supervised Learning: Involves training a model on labeled data, where the input data and the corresponding output labels are known. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

Unsupervised Learning: The model learns patterns from unlabeled data. It is often used for clustering and association tasks. Examples include k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).

Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. This approach is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicles.

Deep Learning: A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets. It is particularly effective in tasks like image and speech recognition.

Applications
Machine learning is transforming various industries through its applications in:

Healthcare: Predictive analytics for disease diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring.
Marketing: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems, and sentiment analysis.
Transportation: Autonomous driving, traffic prediction, and route optimization.
